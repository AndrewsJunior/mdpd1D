Instructions:

ConvergenceTable.m is a Matlab program that computes the convergence rates of our proposed method hybrid 
MDPD(GD/NM) and reference estimator (MCD) applied to location and scale estimation with matched nominal 
breakdown point values across various alpha's.

ConvergenceTableRobust.m computes the convergence rates of our proposed method hybrid MDPD(GD/NM) and
reference estimator MCD applied to location and scale estimation with matched nominal breakdown point
values for various alpha's. Robust warmstart is used in this Matlab program.
