Instructions:

APPEXAMPLE.m plots robust Q-Q graph, outlier detection graph and density graph for the time series data
used.

APPEXAMPLECOMPAR.m compares the MSEs of three location and scale estimators including our proposed hybrid
MDPD(GD/NM), MCD and usual mean/standard deviation.  

APPGBMEXAMPLE2.m plots the time series data, estimates the parameters of the GBM based on the first 144
records (months) and makes predictions for the next 24 months. The program also estimates a prediction 
region for the next 24 months and plots graphs for the predictions.
