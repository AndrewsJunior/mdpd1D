The Matlab programs reproduce results reported in paper titled 
	"A Hybrid Method for Density Power Divergence Minimization 
	With Application to Robust Univariate Location And Scale Estimation" 
by Andrews T. Anum and Michael Pokojovy.

Instructions:

1) The "examples" folder includes Matlab programs used to generate graphs reported in the Example section
based on a time series data. See "examples/readme". 

2) The "supplement" folder contains Matlab programs used to generate supplementary graphs.
See "supplement/readme".

3) The "runtimeanalysis" folder contains Matlab programs toperform runtime analysis 
for our proposed method (hybrid MDPD (GD/NM)) vs. "plain" GD method. 
See "runtimeanalysis/readme" for details.

4) The "breakdownpointanalysis" folder contains the program to perform empirical breakdown point analysis 
of our method vs. minimum covariance determinant (MCD) estimator. 
See "runtimeanalysis/readme" for details.

5) See "convergencerate/readme" for instructions on how to run a simulation to compare 
the empirical convergence rate of our method vs. MCD.
